# warpgate

**Warpgate**  is  a browser  extension  whose  goal is  to  create  a quick  and
painless  way  to  access  "external   bookmarks",  i.e.  URLs  that  have  been
pinned/starred/bookmarked in a third-party service or webapp.

> For now, Warpgate only works  with starred GitHub repos. Suggestions for other
> services are welcomed!
